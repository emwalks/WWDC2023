- Jeremy Jones: Media Experience Team
- Requirements:
  - Xcode target must build with this platform's SDK. Compatible iOS apps built with the iOS SDK will get an iOS compatible experience.
  - Use AVPlayerViewController
  - Present the view controller so it fills the window.
  - Create a new player item with the content URL and set it on the player.
  - Adding the item after setting the player on the view controller can **improve performance** because the player will understand how it will be displayed before it starts loading the media.
  - Then, to use it in SwiftUI, wrap that code in a UIViewControllerRepresentable.
